How to contribute to the repository
-----------------------------------

Once you're a member of the organization, you should be able to push to the
main repository. To do this, you can clone the main repository by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/exosamsi/EccentricityDistribution.git
```

or, if you already have a checked out copy, you can point it at the main
repository by running:

```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/exosamsi/EccentricityDistribution.git
```

In this step, `origin` is the *name* of the remote. `origin` is what git
called the repository that you originally cloned.
